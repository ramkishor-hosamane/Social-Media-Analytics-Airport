Spread over 4,000 acres (1,600 ha), it is located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of the city near the village of Devanahalli. It is owned and operated by Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL), a public–private consortium. The airport opened in May 2008 as an alternative to increased congestion at HAL Airport, the original primary commercial airport serving the city. It is named after Kempe Gowda I, the founder of Bangalore. Kempegowda International Airport became Karnataka's first fully solar powered airport developed by CleanMax Solar.
Kempegowda Airport is the third-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the country, behind the airports in Delhi and Mumbai, and is the 29th busiest airport in Asia. It handled around 33.30 million passengers in the calendar year 2018 with 658 aircraft movements a day. The cargo handled by the airport continues to increase steadily, with the airport handling about 386,849 tonnes (426,428 short tons) of cargo between April 2018 and March 2019.",a month ago

On 6th March evening around 730 pm i did security check in on the extreme left hand side- last but one x ray belt.
I was traveling from Bangalore to Hyderabad by spicejet flight SG 1239.

I had removed all electronic accessories and kept it on the tray. I had also removed my dash mobile charging adaptor. Post screening when i collected my 
other items I saw that the dash Mobile charger  was missing.
I informed the concerned security staff about the missing item - either it might have fallen or misplaced or someone might have lifted it - Please check?. He did a half hearted check, didn't find anything and instead was asking me if i really screened it?

If you are new to Bangalore and a budget traveller, do opt for the amazing shuttle services we have. It is the cheapest mode to get inside the city and also the safest. The shuttle services cover maximum connecting places of the city during odd hours as well. 
Coming to food, if you are looking for a place where food rates are cheaper then you can take a left right at the the departure, go straight and a left inside the airport, you will get a self service food center where you find the cheapest food within the airport premises.

The proactive actions by the the airport operator makes this possible .
As you drive to the airport , the only difficult is getting a place to alight  and after alighting you have the trolleys available at various places for you to grab and as you walk towards the entrance Marshall guide the traffic to cross . Buggies are available for the persons with walking difficulty and paid porters are available to take your bags till check in . There are   more than 10  manned by security for entry into the terminal  and a separate gate for passenger only with hand bag. There are enough kiosk available to print your boarding pass  and the air lines manage the check in process efficiently . There are enough eating places inside and after the security and offer various cuisines . The important point where there is bottle neck is the  security and cabin baggage  check . The airport has conveyor for the bags . Now there are people manning every entry leading baggage drop and he allows only when the place is free for bagge to drop so that unnecessary crowd pushung and pulling is avoided . The security is friendly and they keep helping for pushing the bags and keep announcing to itmes that need to be put into the baggage Carsoel .

But dont get confused that kempegowda Bus terminal or kempegowda Railway or kempegowda metro station are so close from kempegowda Airport.  Bcoz airport is situated far from above three.  
Roads connecting to airport are like highway my ola driver was driving even at the speed of 110kmph. That's enjoying and terrifying at the same time. Even most of the vehicles are going by that speed. So you should warn your driver regarding this.

My feeling is that, they should have a theme, unique to Karnataka, that should make a Traveller wait/ pause for a moment, possibly take a selfie.
Also Hi speed connectivity - Delhi Metro - Airport Express is worth mentioning - reducing travel time - Also giving opportunity to Traveller to explore places, cuisine eg Chandni Chowk parathe, during 3-4 hours waiting time. I have put some pics of Delhi Metro token, visit to Paratha shop at Chandni Chowk. This is for our guys here,  to learn from our own decision makers of other states who have fostered such facility.

Kempegowda Airport is the third-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the country, behind the airports in Delhi and Mumbai, and is the 29th busiest airport in Asia. In the fiscal year of 2017–18, in terms of international traffic it is the 5th busiest airport in the country behind Delhi and Mumbai, Chennai and Cochin.[7] It handled over 25.04 million passengers in the calendar year 2017 with over 600 aircraft movements a day. The cargo handled by the airport continues to increase steadily, with the airport handling about 386,849 tonnes (426,428 short tons) of cargo between April 2018 and March 2019.[8]

The airport consists of two runways and passenger terminal, which handles both domestic and international operations. The second runway, constructed by Larsen & Toubro, was commissioned on 5 December 2019. A second terminal is in the early stages of construction. Also, there is a cargo village and three cargo terminals. The airport serves as a hub for AirAsia India, Alliance Air, and IndiGo and a focus city for Air India and SpiceJet.
RunwaysEdit

Kempegowda Airport has two runways in use. A second parallel runway has been built as a part of the expansion plans of the airport as of 5 December 2019.[52]

Runway 09/27: 4,000 by 45 metres (13,123 ft × 148 ft), CAT I, ILS equipped.[53][54]

Four years after it was laid, the runway was entirely resurfaced because of a serious decline in quality.[55] From 11 March to 3 April 2012, it was closed daily between 10:30 am and 5:30 pm.[56] As a result, BIAL accused construction company Larsen & Toubro of building the runway poorly.[57] South of runway 09/27 are a full-length parallel taxiway and the apron, which extends from the Blue Dart/DHL terminal to the passenger terminal.

The second runway has completed constrution at the airport, and is under limited operations until Mar 2020. The runway will cater to all types of aircraft including Code-F aircraft like Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8 and will be equipped with CAT IIIB ILS. The runway will also feature an associated parallel taxiway and two cross-field taxiways on the east linking the new runway to the existing north runway and the aprons at terminal 1 and terminal 2. The existing runway will also be upgraded as part of the expansion work.Initial work on the new 4000m x 45 m parallel runway began in February 2016. After completion, this new runway will be named the 09R/27L runway and the other runway will be renamed 09L/27R.

Terminal 1 accommodates both domestic and international operations. It covers 150,556 m2 (1,620,570 sq ft) and can handle 20 million passengers annually.[46][48] Check-in and baggage reclaim are situated on the lower floor, while departure gates are located on Level-1 and the ground floor. Gates 1, 2, 12–18, 28–30 on Level-1 are used for domestic departures, gates 31–42 on Level-1 are used for International departures, gates 3–9 and gates 19–25 form the Western and Eastern bus gates respectively.Gate 41–42 is equipped to serve the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. Lounges are provided by Above Ground Level and Plaza Premium Lounge, which also operates a day hotel in the terminal.For VIPs there is a separate 930-square-metre (10,000 sq ft) lounge.

Under the second phase of the airport's expansion a new terminal called Terminal 2 is being built.",5 months ago

I have traveled multiple times through this airport while flying from overseas in 2012, 2015, 2017, even as recently in 2019, apart from couple of domestic flights which I took to Bengaluru recently.

The airport in itself is quite far away from the city, but close to Hebbal.  It's a risky business leaving to the airport from the city, especially if you have to catch a domestic flight, compared to an international flight where you have the leeway of reporting in 3 hours or a bit more earlier due to any imminent security requirements or demands.  This is mainly due to the outrageous traffic which leads to congestion and traffic jams, a daily story for Bengalureans.  You will reach the airport in almost two hours from the city, depending on the number of vehicles, in spite of all the flyovers built.

The airport has all the necessary and useful facilities ranging from leave your baggage, duty free shops, curios/handicrafts, plenty of eateries, inside and outside etc.  Remember having Ghee roast/Dosa and tea, apart from having pizza from one of the outlets in the International terminal in 2012.  It was very expensive, almost double the cost from what you pay outside.  It was not a good idea or not necessary before you board a flight to fly abroad.  In 2015, I tried 7 Tawas and just had regular tea, before departing, apart from 2017.  They had all kinds of foods and even alcohol or beer which I never tried.  Have tried Subway outside in 2015, besides recently which has always been a busy place.  However, they do offer very good fresh sandwiches which you could just carry on with you for a quick bite while inside the terminal/take home, far less expensive as well!  

Tried Hatti Kappi twice at the arrivals gate, recently while arriving in Bengaluru on two different domestic flights.  It's a pretty affordable place where you even have some combo options and all vegetarian, if I amn't mistaken, next to Pizza Hut.  This is among a few eat out options, before you catch your rides.  There are currently a whole lot new places already open and doing really well.  Relish on some pastries, cakes/ice cream, a filter coffee/tea.

This is a high security airport which I know from experience.  Customs frisked a necklace in 2012, which happened to be just personal effects and for the only reason, the item being gold and since we were flying out of Dubai.  It was just an inconvenience due to further delays to reach baggage retrieval.  

The airport has multiple lounges.  Tried the Plaza Premium lounge in 2015.  It's a very expensive place for a few hours, should say ""couple"" of hours.  The single room in itself is very crammed and not enough space for the money you spend.  They do offer a hot buffet, apart from some free magazines.

Kempegowda International offers BMTC buses to the city and even has a bus stand outside.  KSRTC offers luxury Flybus services not only to Mysuru, but also to Tirupathi, Coorg, Mangalore, Hyderabad and Salem etc.  It has chemical toilets inside and provides mineral water.  You can book tickets online, pay at the counter outside the airport or even pay cash inside, upon boarding.

Things which needs some improvements:

Immigration counters were very slow, shortly after midnight recently on an incoming flight from Paris.  It took more than half an hour to get it over.  

The bags arrival at the carousel recently were confusing and not correct which further delayed my time getting out.

The restrooms were pretty small and one was totally full after exiting a domestic flight recently.  Couple of incoming flights could make a huge difference!  

The seating area, once you enter the international departures, next to ticketing  could get really crowded with hardly any seats left during times of multiple departing flights.",5 months ago

Food as expected is expensive compared to outside. Travel time from City to airport takes around 1 hour during non peak hours. Expect 2 hours travel during peak hours. Buses to airport is very convenient. Climate near airport is bit cooler(usually 2 degrees less) compared to city. Cabs are plenty available outside airport for arrivals.,a year ago

The airport is quite big and has 7-8 food outlets and 10-15 shopping outlet in just the domestic departure terminal. Not sure about the international one as I haven’t travelled abroad from Bengaluru.

Sadly they have only one operational runway but a new terminal is under construction. The new terminal would be only for international flights. It will have world class features and said to be the most advanced airport in India. Expected to be completed by late 2020.

They have good outlets like taste of India, KFC, eat in Bangalore etc. mostly having South Indian cuisines. They don’t have Pizza Hut, Mcdonalds or subway which I feel is necessary.

This is not traveller friendly. I suggest finding a way to allow foreign travelers to register EASILY without needing to use a SIM. 

Minus another star because of the Kotak ATM monopoly at the exit of the terminal. Only one type of ATM and I guess I was unlucky as this ATM didn’t work with my cards.

Had to walk to next nearest ATM to get cash to take the bus as I wasn’t allowed to rentrer the terminal to use the Bank of India ATM listed inside.

Stays at two stars because of water refill facilities and generally it’s an okay airport.

UPDATE : Reduced to one star!!!

Upon exciting India, I found out that apparently in the electronic system there was no record of me entering India. I had stamps in my passport, my old boarding pass and even the airline confirmed I was on the flight. I was held up by customs for nearly two hours as they tried to figure it out. My partner who I travel with’s information was in the system, which helped my cause. In the end, it only waste time, the immigration realized it was their mistake and stamped me out and decided to resolve it later I guess. (Note : I did not depart from Bengaluru.)

Seems like the immigration offers in Bengaluru Airport don’t know how to do their job correctly!",8 months ago
