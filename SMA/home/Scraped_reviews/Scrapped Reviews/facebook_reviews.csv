Due to huge delay at the security check in, I missed by scheduled flight by 10 mins. With more than 100 passengers at the same time, only 2 counters were open. No ground staff to help or reach to. I was bound to pay 1000 bucks extra for the next flight again. <br/> Can I have some explanation for my fault here? Despite reaching 1.5 hrs before time, I was hecled early in the morning, without any justification from airline's or KIAL's end. I wish to have justice about the same. I wish to have my money refunded immediately. It may not be a matter of money,  but a settlement must be reached. <br/> Atmaja</p>",9 June 2018

He took my passport and went to another security officer, then another, then another. Finally, to my horror, ALL the security officers came to the booth where I was waiting, leering, looking me up and down, laughing and talking in the local language. Finally, on<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">e of them asked me in English, ""How many times has your guru touched you?"" I told them never. Then another asked, ""Did he ever try to touch you under your clothes?"" I said no. They all kept laughing and I could see by their expressions they were imagining all kind of gross things about me. I felt like I couldn't fight back because they have weapons and they were holding my passport. I just wanted to go home to Canada after a beautiful time in India, but these rascals made my homeward journey scary and humiliating. I will never leave India from Bengaluru International again.

He asked me go to INDIGO customers care, again  they asked me to go LOST AND FOUND, again then they asked me to go to CISF, finally cisf asked me wait at GATE 13 for 10 minutes. Almos<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">t waited for 1 hour no response. Some how the gate security helped me to check with rest room cleaner, and came to know that my watch had already handover to CISF. Again I went to CISF, offices were very busy in talking themselves, not even bother to attend. When I asked he said to wait again, I replied how Long - the answer he said is he has only one officer and it will take time. I thought myself “ CISF also running short staff”. Then again went back to gate 13 and waited another 30 min.another officer in the next gate called me and asked to go the CISF senior officer @gate 9. Finally I senior officer in gate 9 helped me to get the watch. I also. Thanked  him. After 2 hours running to both ends of airport for atleast 8 times I got my watch.</span></p>",9 September 2019

I had a long layover at the Bangalore airport before taking the flight to London. I had to literally beg to the CISF to let me out and get in since there is no eatery in the waiting area except for CCD. <br/> Secondly,the day use hotel was under renovation on 3rd July and the Premium lounge could be accessed only after the immigration which was not possible so early. Neither the immigration authorities,nor the airport staff was helpful enough to grant me access to the VIP waiting lounge. Seems like you don’t want to treat customers well.</p>",30 July 2019
Kauser Jan Shaik,<u>3 star</u>,https://www.facebook.com/kauser.shaik/posts/10210959509410965:0,<p>A major bug bear for me is how gender discrimination is extended even to the airport. The women's security queues are a mile long with only 1 or 2 stations where as the men's queues are a breeze through with 7-8 stations. <br/> Another problem is when staff send you from the main queue to form 'little queues' behind people checking in so they can breathe down the people in front's necks!<br/> That is seriously annoying.<br/> Hope the airport looks at other major airports and learns.</p>,8 February 2017

Having 3 female lanes and 15 or so male lanes is obviously going to lead to an inefficient system. Even if there were fewer females flying in this day and age, having less than a 60:40 does not make sense. Every female that passes through Bengaluru airport requests you to increase the security check lanes for females - to atleast 7-8 lanes. Would make for a much better and easier (efficient) experience.</p>",22 January 2019
Kailasa's Ma Nithya Aprameyananda,<u>1 star</u>,https://www.facebook.com/joanna.patora.3/posts/1469991043084300:0,"<p>My friends and devotees of Paramahamsa Nithyananda have faced harassment at the airport during this past week. 4 people were denied access to the country although all have visas present and are tourists and seekers. <br/> The immigration officers told one of them that in the future they will not allow Paramahamsa Nithyananda devotees. Another one has faced verbal abuse and was asked where, how her Guru was touching her. Can airport authorities look into what is going on the airport? I and my friends will be definitely seeking a legal advice and avoid Bengaluru airport. Shame that one of the true voices of Hinduism and his devotees are being harassed.</p>",26 November 2017

Then, I kind of lost it when I was literally stared at with annoyance by the security guy and was rudely told to remove them. I did. Then he again scanned my bag and asked me to remove the coins also! Are you serious??!!! Coins???!! And when I did, the guy had the courage to use the words - “Bahut gareeb hai tu?!” <br/> This is simply abuse of power. The guy should be glad that I missed to note his name. This was outrageous! Who the hell treats people like that?! Hey could get angry, raise his voice but not use such words. Get your house together!!

Limited food and drinks are available (one push-cart on the day I travelled) in the checkin area and once you get into the checkin area, you are not allowed to return to the outside food outlet area. You will have to wait till after you’ve cleared immigration. So if you’ve arrived early (to beat the traffic congestion), you are hungry and your checkin counter isn’t open yet. Good luck! Happy travels!<br/> I suggest the airport authorities to inform passengers loud and clear that the checkin area is highly secured and it’s a point of no return with limited food options within the checkin area.</p>",16 November 2018

I was meant ally harresed and after paying a lakh and seven thousand as my ticket price made to wait for more than an hour here and there and traumatized I told them I will go and if they deport me I will deal with it .. as I have landed in Ireland I hav not been deported .. the Emirates ground staff and Mr Tony Christopher are totally incompetent and rude people ..
