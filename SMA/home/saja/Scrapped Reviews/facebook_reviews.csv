Sai Mahesh J,,https://www.facebook.com/jsaima/posts/4824669604272008,"<p>This has been more like a hang out place and I've visited here more than the times I've traveled out of this airport. They have a lovely ambience and open mall sort of set up outside the terminal area. I visit this store here ""The Gourmet Food"" pretty often. They have some amazing stuff, excellent quality, well priced and great staffs.. do take some time to visit their store in case you transit through KIAL. Apart from that, they got Sub Way, nice other eateries.. lot of options. Definitely worth to spent an evening adding to the drive on traffic free stretch to the airport itself.</p>",20 December at 19:06
