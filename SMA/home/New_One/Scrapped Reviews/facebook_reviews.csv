Sree Bhat,<u>4 star</u>,https://www.facebook.com/sree.bhat.7/posts/10155054701037670:0,"<p>We complain a lot about the condition of public toilets in India (certainly with good reason). But have you seen toilet cleaning staff welcome you with ""Namaskara""?<br/> Yes, it happens in Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore. Munianjaneyappa takes care of one of the toilets and he keeps his domain sparklingly clean, welcomes every user, guides them to the facilities. When you are about to leave he even wishes you ""happy journey"" (My wife tells me it's the same great service in the Ladies' too. A big thank you to Munianjaneyappa and his colleagues and the authorities.</p>",7 July 2017

Kailasa's Ma Nithya Shivamayananda,<u>1 star</u>,https://www.facebook.com/MaNithyaShivamayaAnanda/posts/1760510870639268:0,"<p>Over 10 of my friends were in seperate cases harassed by airport officers with abusive language and abusive behavior like surrounding one of my friends with all the officers, laughing at her, making dirty jokes in Karnataka and next starting abusing our beloved guru Sri Paramahamsa Nithyananda. It is pure religious discrimination and hatred. Another had to meet an immigration officer in a seperate room who questioned her although she had the right papers and treathened to make it really hard for anyone from USA to enter India. Is this how the airport wants to tread spiritual tourists from the West?????!!!</p>",26 November 2017

Sarah Landry,<u>1 star</u>,https://www.facebook.com/ma.nithya.sudevi/posts/10154811075805764:1,"<p>I was sexually harassed by Immigration Officers while leaving India. The officers whose station I went through started to laugh when he saw I was wearing a mala with Nithyanandaji's picture on it, and told me to wait. He took my passport and went to another security officer, then another, then another. Finally, to my horror, ALL the security officers came to the booth where I was waiting, leering, looking me up and down, laughing and talking in the local language. Finally, on<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">e of them asked me in English, ""How many times has your guru touched you?"" I told them never. Then another asked, ""Did he ever try to touch you under your clothes?"" I said no. They all kept laughing and I could see by their expressions they were imagining all kind of gross things about me. I felt like I couldn't fight back because they have weapons and they were holding my passport. I just wanted to go home to Canada after a beautiful time in India, but these rascals made my homeward journey scary and humiliating. I will never leave India from Bengaluru International again. I've come here 9 times, and have never had this problem in any airport but Bengaluru.</span></p>",26 November 2017
